	      This game can generate 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 sudoku game with variable difficulty level
	      starting from easy to hard.
	      It allows to save game, peek solution of the current game while playing itself.
	      We can also submit our final ans to check if we have entered elements at their
	      proper place.
	      We can also solve a Sudoku game problem in this program i.e if we provide progam a
	      a Sudoku question it gives us solution of that question.
	      
	      
	      For generating a game it first fill the diagnal matrices fo the grid and then fills
	      remaining elements according to them. It the randomy removes specific no. of elements
	      from the board produced according to the difficult level choosed.
	      After generating Board it saves that board so that becomes our solution,
	      and after removing elements the board produced becomes our question that i have saved in
	      another file for futher use.
	      Savegame function works on similar lines.
